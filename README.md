Thaumcraft 4.1 Research Helper
==========

[This script](http://jimmon89.github.io/tcresearch/) helps you with your Thaumcraft 4.x research. If you have a research note with two aspects that you don't know how to connect, this is your tool.

+ Select the __aspect from wich__ you have to __start__.
+ Select the __aspect__ you have __to get to__.
+ Additionally, you can __specify the minimum number of steps__ needed, that is, the number of empty spaces between the two aspects in your research note.
+ __Hit Go!__

If you are unhappy with the path you got, because you do not have access to those aspects yet or they are quite rare, simply disable those aspects in the config section. Besides, clicking an aspect in the search result will rerun the search again, but with aspect disabled (just momentarily).
